# Retrieval-augumented-generation
This project implements a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using LangChain and HuggingFace, featuring semantic chunking, hybrid retrieval (FAISS + BM25), query expansion, cross-encoder reranking, and evaluation with Exact Match, ROUGE, and METEOR. Includes a user-friendly Gradio interface for interactive question answering.
